This step is crucial to ensure that the data is of high quality and can be accurately quantified. One popular tool for quality control is FastQC, which generates various quality metrics such as per-base sequence quality, adapter contamination, and GC content.\nTo perform quality control using FastQC, run the following command:\nfastqc input.fastq\nThis will generate a HTML report that can be viewed in a web browser.\n\nAnother popular quality control program is fastp. Here is a very nice tutorial on using fastp"

Each student will be developing and completing a research project targeting journal article submission by the end of the Quarter. There will be an emphasis on developing habits that increase automation which in turn will facilitate reproducibility. The primary course platform will be centered around GitHub, with each student creating their own repositories.\nurl: https://sr320.github.io/course-fish546-2023/"
